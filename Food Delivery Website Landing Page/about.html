        wanted to bring the restaurant experience to people's homes. With
        backgrounds in culinary arts, hospitality, and technology, our team set
        out to create a platform that would connect customers with top-rated
        chefs and local restaurants, offering a wide range of cuisines and

        or dietary preference. Today, we continue to uphold our founding values
        of quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, serving thousands of
